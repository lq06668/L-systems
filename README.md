# L-systems
L-systems, also known as Lindenmayer systems, model the growth and development of complex structures in fungi, plants, and other natural systems.
Purpose of evolving L systems using Evolutionary algorithm is to derive Trees that are aesthetically pleasing as well as have the functionality of a real life Tree structure.  
This project aims to extend the use of Evolutionary Algorithms for optimizing DOL-Systems(deterministic context-free L-system)

Examples of some evolved Trees with certain parameters fixed for the fitness function.
